# ATRIUM CO-WORKING SITE

Jekyll-based static website for ATRIUM CO-WORKING LUXURY.

## How to use
1. Replace placeholder images:
   - `assets/images/logo.png` (logo)
   - `assets/images/photo1.jpg`, `photo2.jpg`, `photo3.jpg` (your 3 photos)
   - `assets/video/hero.mp4` (your hero video)
   - `assets/images/whatsapp-icon.png` (small whatsapp icon)
2. Edit `_config.yml` → set `url` and `baseurl` if needed.
3. Push to GitHub repo named `atrium-coworking-site`.
4. In repo settings → Pages, set source to `main` (or `gh-pages`) branch root and choose `jekyll` default.
5. Wait a minute — your site will be live at `https://<your-username>.github.io/atrium-coworking-site/`.

If you want, I can produce a ready-to-upload ZIP of the repo structure next.
